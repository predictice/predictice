# PREDICTICE


Hey dear readers ✌️


**As the engineering team of PREDICTICE, we will share how we are building and participating in developing a platform for analyzing and storing legal data, with some news about our tech products.**


## **What is Predictice?**

Predictice is a SaaS platform that delivers real time analytics to law professionals helping them save time in their legal research and boost performance & customer satisfaction. 🚀

## **The engineering team behind Predictice**

Our engineering team is currently made up of 8 developers, but we are part of a bigger team called Research and Development which is also composed of designer, data, product and jurist people. 

The engineering team is composed of back-end, full-stack, front-end developers, as well as one data scientist and finally data engineers. This team is directed by Tommaso Bianco, who is Predictice’s beloved CTO, whose role is essentially to examine the short- and long-term needs of Predictice and utilizes capital to make investments designed to help reaching the objectives.

Predictice is based in Paris, France, but 80% of us are working in full remote mode, which means that some of us can code while enjoying a beautiful view of the ocean, the fields, the mountain, but also some other foreign landscapes such as the Big Ben in London . 
Of the entire team which composed Predictice, 1/3 of the team is now 100% teleworking everywhere in France and the rest benefit from 2 or 3 remote days per week.


Predictice attaches fundamental importance to the working environment of its employees (offices, sport, knowledge sharing, team events, etc.) to allow them to flourish and achieve excellence in their missions.

## **What are our challenges?** 

Our main goal is to gather the tech team together and to skill-up on various subjects (not only on pure technical issues, but also on ideas to improve our organization).

On the one hand, these challenges give us the opportunity to experiment with new technologies, either to solve internal operational problems, or to improve or even start new features... On the other hand, these meetings allow us to capitalize on existing knowledge, so that developing habits and tips become lingua franca.

## **Our Tech Stack**
- Spring-Boot
- Java
- Elasticsearch
- Scala
- Python
- Kubernetes
- GitLab
- Docker
- Kibana
- Keras
- Apache Spark
- Scikit-learn
- GitLab CI
- And many others...
